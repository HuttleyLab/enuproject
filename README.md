# Classification of mutations

This repo consists of two parts: (1) loglin, (2) classifier. The first of these contains scripts and results from analysis of ENU-induced and spontaneous germline mutations in the mouse for neighbour base associations. The second applies machine learning techniques to classify variants as having derived from one of these processes.
