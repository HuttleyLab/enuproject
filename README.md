# Classification of mutations

This repo consists of two analyses components: 

#### loglin

This directory contains the scripts and results of the log-linear analysis for examination of the neighbourhood effects on ENU-induced and spontaneous germline mutations in the mouse, respectively. Please refer to the README.rst file inside this directory for detailed explaination regarding the package installation and the analyses implementation.

#### classifier 
This directory contains the scripts and results of applying machine learning techniques to classify variants as having derived from ENU treatment or occur spontaneously in the mouse genome. Again, for detailed installation and implementation guidelines, please refer to the README.rst file inside this directory.
